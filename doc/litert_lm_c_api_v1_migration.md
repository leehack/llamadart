# LiteRT-LM C API 1.0 consumer preparation

Issue #1677 owns adoption. The public `LiteRtLmRuntimeClient` continues to
reject C API 1.0. Pins, companion assets and published support stay on 0.18.
`LiteRtLmV1Runtime` is internal preparation code, unexported from package entry
points and unselected by production backend dispatch.

The first adapter targets exact owner candidate `94db8c5` with upstream
`771b06e1` (`v0.19.0`). It binds only explicit status-return/output-parameter
signatures from that candidate's `c/engine.h`, checks version 1.0.x and required
exports before operations, and reads thread-local errors synchronously before
cleanup. It preserves typed diagnostics and path redaction. C API 1.0 must
never pass through the legacy typedefs or callback proxy.

| Family | Preparation status | Adoption gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version/status errors | Explicit 1.0.x probe; older/future/missing exports refuse | Both directions of artifact skew |
| Settings/engine | CPU, bounded context/threads, explicit isolated cache, owned engine | More settings/backends and platform evidence |
| Session/raw text | Fresh greedy synchronous session, explicitly no template application; UTF-8 copy, response and partial-failure cleanup | Production worker dispatch and cancellation transport |
| Conversations/history/tools | Internal one-at-a-time text conversation with native history; no tool API | Production dispatch, history/tool policy and broader models |
| Callback streaming/termination | Internal owner-proxy ABI 2 copied JSON, final+drain ownership, cancel/delete/recreate | Production worker transport and full-family/platform qualification |
| ASR | Public compatibility refusal remains | ABI-v1 bridge routing, model-family and lifecycle controls |
| Embeddings/schema | Public compatibility refusal remains | Regenerated/audited signatures, capabilities and model regressions |
| Hook/SPM/inventory | No changes | Qualified owner publication, TopK removal, bidirectional companion checks |

Raw text generation blocks its owning isolate. It exposes no cancellation or
cross-isolate handles. Every request owns and deletes its own session; engine
reload retains the previous engine if candidate creation fails. Disposal is
final and idempotent. This bounded preparation API cannot establish an app
feature, tool-loop safety, exact usage, async cancellation or broad GPU support.

Tests compile a versioned fixture with live-object counters and inject failures
at each creation/status/output stage. The existing public ABI guard and its
legacy tests remain separate. Any real-model receipt must identify the exact
candidate/model hashes and actual backend; fixture success is not inference
qualification. Source stays draft until remaining families are migrated.

## Initial macOS arm64 evidence

Candidate owner `94db8c5`, library SHA-256
`6ae8a0038f4fa71a9403ccdb91bf4bf71cd792beb44191f2bcc187e6ef70d31d`,
with Qwen3-0.6B SHA-256
`555579ff2f4fd13379abe69c1c3ab5200f7338bc92471557f1d6614a6e5ab0b4`:
CPU engine creation and two fresh raw-text sessions execute through this
adapter. A direct native C API reference emits identical text (`2`) for the
recorded arithmetic prompt; this is ABI/lifetime parity, not arithmetic
correctness or public backend qualification. The candidate rejects the declared
Greedy sampler enum with UNIMPLEMENTED; use TopP with top-k 1 and temperature 0,
as the owner qualification tools do. The original unsuccessful probes are
retained separately from passing parity receipts.

## Internal conversation preparation

The next slice targets upstream `83ce6067f2e2a3fb697556928f93936693ded971`
and the owner `bf4e1188e1135152a8ce4e7dc057c13041cf18a1` candidate (PR92's
source-equivalent main tree). It adds an unexported conversation implementation
without changing public dispatch, shipped pins, legacy bindings or companions.
It requires the version-checked 1.0 runtime plus owner `stream_proxy_*` exports
and callback ABI **2**, rejecting old, missing or unknown proxy ABIs before
allocating a conversation. It never registers a Dart listener for upstream's
borrowed opaque chunks. The owner proxy copies each string before the native
callback returns; Dart copies those owned strings and frees both text and error.

`openConversation` owns one child of the loaded CPU engine. `sendText` accepts
only text and returns a turn whose `chunks` stream contains raw native message
JSON. `done` carries the authoritative finish reason or error; it can be awaited
without a chunks subscription. Finish-reason ABI 1 is optional: missing or
unknown versions yield `unknown`, never a guessed cause. This slice provides no
media, tools, schema, ASR, embeddings, single-threaded execution or raw-session
asynchronous generation.

A turn keeps its input, native proxy and `NativeCallable.listener` alive until
the final callback is received **and** `conversation_wait_until_done` succeeds.
A nonfinal error does not release callbacks. Status failures read thread-local
errors synchronously on the calling thread; stream failures use the copied
callback error, with existing path and URL redaction. Canonical CANCELLED text
is treated as normal cancellation only when the native finish-reason extension
independently reports cancellation.

Cancellation requests do not wait. Further copied chunks are freed and
suppressed while native work finishes. The child is deleted after final+drain;
its handle is never reused, even if the cancellation request failed. Create a
new conversation for another turn. A normal completed conversation can accept
another turn, preserving native history. Repeated closing of an old child
cannot detach a newer child from its parent. Engine reload, direct raw-session
generation and disposal refuse while any child exists. Close an idle child or
cancel and await an active one first.

No timer closes a callback. A missing final callback retains its resources.
Failed native drain quarantines the entire child/parent family and refuses
reuse, close, reload and disposal, since callback quiescence is unproved. This
conservative failure can retain native resources and keep its isolate alive;
production worker-exit/recovery policy remains an adoption gate. The current
owner proxy also cannot distinguish absent text from allocation failure, so
this preparation does not establish lossless behavior under native OOM.

Model-free tests use foreign-thread callbacks that overwrite borrowed chunk
storage immediately, lifecycle counters, setup/start/cancel/drain failures and
postcancel callbacks. The failed-drain control runs in its own process so it
can verify retained callbacks and then exit without pretending they are safe to
free. Optional candidate tests live in
`test/integration/litert_lm_v1_candidate_test.dart` (`local-only`); set
`LLAMADART_LITERT_V1_LIBRARY`, `LLAMADART_LITERT_V1_MODEL` and the corresponding
`_SHA256` variables. They check normal history reuse, cancellation and fresh
conversation creation with CPU two-thread decoding. Their output is lifecycle
evidence, not model-semantic, leak-freedom or public-runtime qualification.
