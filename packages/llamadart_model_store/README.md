# llamadart_model_store

A model store that every [`llamadart`](https://pub.dev/packages/llamadart) app
able to open the same directory shares: download a GGUF once and reuse it
across apps, without one app deleting a model another still uses.

- A model and its multimodal projector are one entry.
- Each app records a reference to the entries it uses. A file is deleted only
  when no app references it.
- Files are downloaded, resumed, verified and locked by core's
  `DefaultModelDownloadManager`, so a file becomes visible only once it is
  complete.
- `ModelStore` implements `ModelDownloadManager`, so it plugs into
  `ModelDownloadController` and `ModelFileStore(downloadManager: store)`.

This package is versioned independently of core and is not yet published. It
requires `llamadart` 0.17.

## Use the store when the app has one, else the app cache

```dart
import 'package:llamadart/llamadart.dart';
import 'package:llamadart_model_store/llamadart_model_store.dart';

Future<LlamaModel> resolve(LlamaModel model, String? sharedDirectory) async {
  if (sharedDirectory != null) {
    try {
      final store = await ModelStore.open(
        directory: sharedDirectory,
        appId: 'com.example.chat',
      );
      return (await store.ensure(model)).toLlamaModel();
    } on LlamaUnsupportedException {
      // No shared directory on this platform or file system.
    }
  }
  return model; // The engine downloads into its app-local cache.
}

final engine = await LlamaEngine.load(
  await resolve(
    LlamaModel(
      ModelSource.parse('hf://owner/repo/model-Q4_K_M.gguf'),
      projector: ModelSource.parse('hf://owner/repo/mmproj-F16.gguf'),
    ),
    sharedDirectory,
  ),
);
```

When the app is done with a model:

```dart
await store.release(ModelStore.entryIdFor(model));
```

`entries()` lists complete entries with the apps that reference them, for a
model-library screen.

## Which directory

| Platform | Directory every participating app can open |
| --- | --- |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | A per-user directory, for example under `DefaultModelDownloadManager.defaultSharedCacheDirectory()` |
| Android | A directory the user granted every participating app as a file path. Storage Access Framework content URIs are not paths, and model loaders take paths. |
| iOS, macOS sandboxed | A directory in an App Group container shared by the apps; apps from unrelated developers cannot share one |
| Web | None: `ModelStore.open` throws `LlamaUnsupportedException` |

`ModelStore.open` probes the directory and throws `LlamaUnsupportedException`
when it cannot be created, written or locked.

## Behavior

- `ensure` records the app's reference before downloading, so no other app
  deletes the files while they download. A failed call drops the reference it
  recorded; downloaded and partial files stay for a retry to resume.
- `release`, `remove` and `clear` drop this app's references, then delete
  files no app references. Files another app references, or that are
  downloading elsewhere, stay, and the call throws
  `ModelCacheEntryInUseException` naming them (`release` keeps another
  entry's files silently).
- `prune` deletes only unreferenced files, by age then by size.
- `ensureModel` records a single-file entry, so an engine using the store as
  its download manager is protected the same way. Local files and `noCache`
  downloads pass through without a reference.
- Credentials and `sha256` apply as in `LlamaEngine.load`: credentials are
  never sent to a second host, and `sha256` needs a model without projector.
- Store metadata holds cache keys, app ids and timestamps: every app can read
  the ids of the others. URLs, tokens and headers are never written.
- Downloads run in the foreground. Background transfers need platform
  executors that are not part of this version.
- Use a store from one isolate per process. Its lock excludes other
  processes; on POSIX it does not exclude another isolate of the same process.
- On iOS, the store holds a file lock in the App Group container only for
  the metadata update around a call, and a download holds core's entry lock:
  finish or cancel downloads before the app is suspended.

## Layout

```
<directory>/
  store.lock               store-wide lock for reference changes
  files/                   DefaultModelDownloadManager cache root
  entries/<entry id>/
    entry.json             the entry's file cache keys
    refs/<sha256(appId)>.json
```

Entry ids derive from the files' `ModelSource.cacheKey`s, so every app and
platform computes the same id. An entry whose metadata a store version cannot
read, but which has references, keeps every file: nothing is deleted until it
is released.

for the design and its open questions.
