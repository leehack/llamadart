description: The ModelParams and GenerationParams settings that matter most, native LiteRT-LM runtime and cache controls, and practical defaults for chat and embedding workloads.

`ModelParams` apply at model load; `GenerationParams` apply per generation
call. To decide which knob to change and what to measure, see
[Performance tuning](../guides/performance-tuning).

## ModelParams essentials

```dart
await engine.loadModel(
  '/path/to/model.gguf',
  modelParams: const ModelParams(
    contextSize: 4096,
    gpuLayers: ModelParams.maxGpuLayers,
    preferredBackend: GpuBackend.vulkan,
    splitMode: ModelSplitMode.layer,
    mainGpu: 0,
    numberOfThreads: 0,
    numberOfThreadsBatch: 0,
    batchSize: 0,
    microBatchSize: 0,
    maxParallelSequences: 1,
  ),
);
```

Important fields:

- `contextSize`: total context window.
- `gpuLayers`: number of layers offloaded to GPU.
- `preferredBackend`: backend preference (`auto`, `vulkan`, `metal`, etc).
- `splitMode`: model tensor distribution mode passed through to llama.cpp
  `split_mode`. Defaults to upstream `layer` behavior.
- `mainGpu`: primary GPU device index passed through to llama.cpp `main_gpu`.
  To select one GPU for the full model, use
  `splitMode: ModelSplitMode.none` with the desired `mainGpu` index.
- `batchSize`: context logical batch size (`n_batch`). On native,
  decoder/generative models use the llama.cpp-aligned `min(n_ctx, 2048)`
  default when this is `0`. Native encoder-only models retain a full-context
  logical batch so embedding inputs are not split incorrectly. WebGPU keeps
  full-context automatic batching because model architecture is not available
  before bridge context creation, though model-specific safety presets may be
  smaller.
- `microBatchSize`: context physical micro-batch size (`n_ubatch`). On native,
  decoder/generative models use `min(n_batch, 512)` when this is `0`, while
  encoder-only models retain the resolved logical batch. WebGPU follows its
  resolved logical batch unless a safety preset applies. Explicit positive
  values are preserved within `n_ubatch <= n_batch <= n_ctx`. Native
  encoder-only models and models without a KV cache (such as BERT and
  ModernBERT) embed each input in one micro-batch, so `embed()` throws
  `LlamaInferenceException` for longer input; raise `microBatchSize` and
  `batchSize` to embed it.
- `maxParallelSequences`: max sequence slots (`n_seq_max`) for parallel
  sequence workloads (for example, batched embeddings).
- `loadMtp` (native llama.cpp only): load MTP tensors embedded in the target
  GGUF. Defaults to `false` because the tensors cost memory; set it to `true`
  when `SpeculativeDecodingConfig.mtp(...)` runs without a `draftModelPath`.
- `chatTemplate`: template override for `.litertlm` models. GGUF models always
  use the template embedded in the file.
- `preferMemory64` / `modelBytesHint` (web/WebGPU only): select the 64-bit
  (mem64) bridge core; see
  [Model size and memory64](../platforms/webgpu-bridge#model-size-and-memory64).
  Ignored on native backends.
- `liteRtLm*` fields: native LiteRT-LM `.litertlm` loads only; see
  [LiteRT-LM runtime controls](#litert-lm-runtime-controls).

For runtime LoRA control (`setLora`, `removeLora`, `clearLoras`), see
[LoRA Adapters](../guides/lora-adapters).

## LiteRT-LM runtime controls

Native `.litertlm` loads accept `contextSize`, `chatTemplate` and the fields
below. The `liteRtLm*` tuning fields default to `null`, which keeps the pinned
runtime default.

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `liteRtLmBackend` | `auto` (default), `cpu`, `gpu`, or `npu` (Android). `auto` uses `cpu` when `gpuLayers` is `0`, otherwise it maps `preferredBackend`. |
| `liteRtLmActivationDataType` | Activation type override: `float32`, `float16`, `int16`, or `int8`. Forwarded to `litert_lm_engine_settings_set_activation_data_type`. |
| `liteRtLmPrefillChunkSize` | Prefill chunk size for CPU dynamic models. Must be positive. |
| `liteRtLmParallelFileSectionLoading` | `false` disables parallel `.litertlm` file-section loading, for diagnostics. `null` keeps parallel loading. |
| `liteRtLmDispatchLibDir` | LiteRT dispatch library directory for Android NPU deployments. Must be non-empty. |
| `liteRtLmCacheDir`, `liteRtLmMaxProgramCacheBytes` | Runtime cache directory and GPU program cache size cap; see [LiteRT-LM cache directory](#litert-lm-cache-directory). |
| `numberOfThreads` | Generation thread count; `0` keeps automatic selection. |
| `loras` | At most one adapter, at the default scale of `1.0`, loaded with the model. Runtime LoRA APIs, stacking and custom scales are llama.cpp-only. |

`gpuLayers` must be `0` (CPU) or `ModelParams.maxGpuLayers`. Native
LiteRT-LM throws `ArgumentError` for llama.cpp-specific fields such as
`batchSize`, `numberOfThreadsBatch`, `splitMode`, `mainGpu` or KV-cache types,
so a GGUF tuning profile never appears to apply silently. LiteRT-LM web
accepts `liteRtLmBackend` for CPU or GPU selection and rejects every other
field in the table.

Benchmark load time, prefill and decode throughput, and output quality on the
deployment device after changing the activation type or prefill chunk size.
The LiteRT-LM smoke tool for a repository checkout is in
[Backend benchmarks](../guides/backend-benchmarks#reproducing).

## LiteRT-LM cache directory

The native LiteRT-LM runtime writes cache files such as
`*_mldrift_program_cache.bin` (GPU programs), `*_mldrift_weight_cache.bin`
(GPU weights) and `*.xnnpack_cache`. llamadart only chooses the directory:

| `liteRtLmCacheDir` | macOS, Android | Other native platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `null` (default) | `llamadart_litert_lm` under `Directory.systemTemp` | No directory is passed; the runtime caches next to the model file |
| A path | That directory, created when missing | That directory, created when missing |

`liteRtLmMaxProgramCacheBytes` caps GPU program cache files. `null` (default)
never deletes anything. Otherwise, before each engine create, llamadart
deletes regular files directly inside the effective cache directory whose name
ends with `_mldrift_program_cache.bin` and whose size exceeds the cap. Weight
and XNNPACK caches, subdirectories and symbolic links are left alone. When no
directory is passed to the runtime, nothing is pruned; set `liteRtLmCacheDir`
to enable pruning there. Each deletion, and each prune failure, logs a Dart
`warn` record and never fails the load (see [Logging](./logging)).

```dart
const params = ModelParams(
  liteRtLmCacheDir: '/data/app/litert-cache',
  liteRtLmMaxProgramCacheBytes: 1024 * 1024 * 1024,
);
```

The cap mitigates a known runtime issue
([#552](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/552)): with Qwen3.5-0.8B
on the macOS GPU backend, every engine create appended about 0.5 GB to
`*_mldrift_program_cache.bin`, later creates logged
`Deserialization failed: DATA_LOSS`, and deleting the file did not slow engine
create. llamadart can create an engine more than once per loaded model: on the
first generation or tokenization after each context create, and again when
speculative decoding, vision, audio or image-count settings change.

## Embedding-oriented model params

For `embedBatch(...)`, set `batchSize` and `microBatchSize` explicitly for the
workload and raise `maxParallelSequences` above `1` for true multi-sequence
batching. The decoder defaults do not replace embedding tuning. See
[Embeddings](../guides/embeddings#throughput-tuning-for-embedbatch).

## GenerationParams essentials

For native LiteRT-LM CPU/GPU and LiteRT-LM Web generation, `temp: 0` selects
greedy decoding: llamadart uses `topK: 1` regardless of the requested top-k
value. Positive temperatures retain the requested sampling settings.

```dart
const params = GenerationParams(
  maxTokens: 512,
  temp: 0.7,
  topK: 40,
  topP: 0.9,
  minP: 0.0,
  penalty: 1.1,
  presencePenalty: 0.0,
  stopSequences: ['</s>'],
  thinkingBudget: null,
  speculativeDecoding: false,
  speculativeDecodingConfig: null,
);
```

Important fields:

- `maxTokens`: generation length cap.
- `temp`: randomness.
- `topK`, `topP`, `minP`: token filtering controls.
- `penalty`: repeat penalty.
- `presencePenalty`: llama.cpp-native presence penalty; `0.0` preserves the
  existing behavior. WebGPU and LiteRT-LM reject non-zero values rather than
  silently ignoring them.
- `thinkingBudget`: native llama.cpp-only reasoning-token cap. Use
  `ThinkingBudget(maxTokens: ...)` with `engine.create(...)` to use template
  delimiters automatically, or specify `startTag` and `endTag` for raw
  generation. `0` forces the end delimiter immediately. Any `thinkingBudget`
  is incompatible with speculative decoding, and unsupported backends reject
  it explicitly.
- `speculativeDecoding` / `speculativeDecodingConfig`: opt-in speculative
  decoding. Native LiteRT-LM uses the boolean; native llama.cpp takes a
  `SpeculativeDecodingConfig` strategy. WebGPU and LiteRT-LM web reject both.
  See [Speculative decoding](../guides/performance-tuning#speculative-decoding).
- `seed`: deterministic replay when set.
- `grammar`: constrained decoding with GBNF.

Native GGUF `stopSequences` suppress the first completed marker and any text
following it, including markers split across tokens or embedded inside a token.
Empty stops are ignored. Unfinished marker prefixes are emitted when generation
ends without a match. Template tokens listed in `preservedTokens` remain
available to the chat parser; identical stop entries are excluded from native
text matching. This applies to ordinary and speculative generation.

## Practical tuning defaults

- Deterministic extraction: lower `temp` (`0.1-0.3`) + explicit stops.
- General chat: `temp` around `0.6-0.9`, `topP` around `0.9-0.95`.
- Tool calling: stable `temp` and sufficient `maxTokens` for call payload.
