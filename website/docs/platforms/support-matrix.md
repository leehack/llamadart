description: Check which runtimes, backends and features llamadart supports on each platform, the known limitations, and the pinned runtime versions.
---

Use this page to check whether a runtime or feature works on a platform.
`LlamaBackend()` picks the runtime from the model format: LiteRT-LM bundles run
on LiteRT-LM, and GGUF files run on llama.cpp natively or on the WebGPU bridge
in a browser. Native targets read the file header; web targets use the URL's
extension or `ModelSource.format`
([How routing works](../guides/backend-selection#how-routing-works)). To choose backend modules or leave a
runtime out of the app, see [Native runtime configuration](./native-build-hooks).

| Web | WebGPU, WebAssembly CPU | CPU, GPU through `@litert-lm/core` | Chrome 128, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4 | Qwen3-ASR, WAV, MP3 or FLAC bytes, bridge `v0.1.30+` | Qwen3-TTS, bridge `v0.1.33+`, memory64 | Bridge `v0.1.47+`; checked in headless Chromium on macOS | Not yet ([#780](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/780)) | Experimental |

On Windows, llama.cpp needs the latest Microsoft Visual C++ v14
Redistributable for the app's architecture (x64 or arm64), at least as new as
the build tools of the bundled DLLs, which the bundles do not ship. Stock Windows Server lacks it, and the load error names the DLLs
that failed to load.

Speech to text, text to speech and decision models are experimental. Image
generation is a Preview: its API is experimental and may change, and it needs
the opt-in `stable_diffusion` runtime,
built for iOS 16.4 and macOS 13.3; x64 Linux and Windows CPUs need AVX2, FMA,
F16C and BMI2, Windows needs the latest Microsoft Visual C++ v14
Redistributable (x64), and Android arm64 needs dot-product and fp16. The
desktop models (SDXL-Lightning, FLUX.1-schnell, SD 3.5 Large Turbo,
Z-Image-Turbo) need about 8 to 15 GiB and are validated on macOS Metal; NVIDIA
Vulkan figures come from the native CLI. See
[Image generation](../guides/image-generation#support). GGUF
Qwen3-ASR accepts WAV, MP3 and FLAC; real-model checks cover all three on
native macOS and in headless Chromium. LiteRT-LM ASR is CPU-only streaming
recognition. Decision models run on llama.cpp and WebGPU only; on LiteRT-LM
`DecisionEngine.load` and `attach` throw `LlamaUnsupportedException`. See
[Speech to text](../guides/speech-to-text#choose-an-approach),
[Text to speech](../guides/text-to-speech) and
[Decision models](../guides/decision-models).

`LiteRtLmBackendPreference.auto`, the default, follows `ModelParams`:
`gpuLayers: 0` or a CPU or BLAS `preferredBackend` selects CPU; a GPU
`preferredBackend` (Vulkan, Metal, CUDA, OpenCL or HIP) selects the LiteRT-LM
GPU backend; and `preferredBackend: auto` selects GPU on Android, iOS, macOS
and web, and CPU on Linux and Windows. Linux arm64 has no LiteRT-LM GPU
backend, so a GPU selection there fails the load with `LlamaModelException`;
set `liteRtLmBackend: cpu`. Windows arm64 has no LiteRT-LM runtime. On Linux x64
and Windows x64, GPU uses the LiteRT-LM GPU backend, not CUDA; set
`liteRtLmBackend: cpu` on hosts without a hardware Vulkan driver. NPU is
Android-only; web rejects it.

## Features by runtime

| Feature | Native llama.cpp | WebGPU | Native LiteRT-LM | LiteRT-LM Web |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LoRA | `ModelParams.loras` at load and `setLora` at runtime, stacked and scaled; aLoRA rejected | Same, with bridge assets whose `getLoraAdapterCapabilities()` reports support ([llama-web-bridge#142](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/142)); otherwise rejected | One default-scale text adapter through `ModelParams.loras` at load | No |
| Thinking budget | Text-only generation, without speculative decoding | Text-only, with bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `thinkingBudget` ([llama-web-bridge#144](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/144)); otherwise rejected | No | No |
| Strict `responseFormat` | Yes | Yes, without tools | No | No |
| Lazy grammar | Yes | No: `grammar` applies from the first token, from `root` | No GBNF grammar | No GBNF grammar |
| Presence penalty | Yes | With bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `presencePenalty` ([llama-web-bridge#140](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/140)); otherwise rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value |
| Min-P | Yes | With bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `minP` ([llama-web-bridge#140](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/140)); otherwise rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value |
| Repetition `penalty` | Yes | Yes | No: rejects a value other than the default | No: rejects a value other than the default |
| Speculative decoding | Draft model, MTP, n-gram and DSpark strategies | Same, with bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports the strategy ([llama-web-bridge#153](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/153)); draft and n-gram cache paths are URLs, and MTP uses the model's own layers; otherwise rejected | Runtime default or MTP, for bundles with a speculative drafter; `capabilities` reports the bundle's declaration | No |
| State persistence | Yes | Bridge `v0.1.15+`; WASMFS paths, lost on page reload | No | No |
| Embeddings | Yes | Bridge `v0.1.7+` | No | No |
| Next-token scores | Yes | Bridge `v0.1.52+` | No | No |
| Per-request usage | `usage` on the final `create` chunk | Bridge `v0.1.54+` | No | No ([#725](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/725)) |
| Operation observers | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `llamaCpp` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `llamaCpp` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `liteRtLm` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `liteRtLm` |
| Multi-turn `ChatSession` | Yes | Yes | Yes | No: single-turn text prompts only |
| Tool calling | Yes | Yes | Yes | No: tools do not reach the model |
| Multimodal | Image and audio with a projector | Image and audio with a projector URL | Image and audio files or bytes, when the bundle supports them | No |
| Video | No | No | No | No |

`LlamaEngine.supportsVideo` returns `false` on every runtime, and passing
`LlamaVideoContent` throws `LlamaUnsupportedException`. Web state paths point
into the bridge's WASMFS virtual filesystem; to keep state across reloads,
export and import it in app code. Bridge assets `v0.1.54+`, the default pin
among them, report the WebGPU LoRA, thinking-budget, presence-penalty, Min-P
and speculative decoding capabilities; older assets report none of them.
After a load, `LlamaEngine.runtime` names the runtime and
`LlamaEngine.capabilities` reports the rows of this table for the loaded model:
media input, embeddings, next-token scores, multi-turn chat, tools, structured
output and grammars, sampling controls and speculative decoding. Guides:

## Known limitations

- iOS x86_64 simulator: no LiteRT-LM runtime is published. Apps that include
  LiteRT-LM must exclude the x86_64 simulator architecture; llama.cpp still
  builds for it.
- Linux x64 LiteRT-LM GPU needs a hardware Vulkan driver. On Mesa llvmpipe
  alone it answers a few prompts, then crashes the process; use `cpu` on such
  hosts ([#572](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/572)).
- Android LiteRT-LM GPU on adapters with a 128 MiB storage-buffer binding
  limit, such as Adreno 750: a model with a larger weight buffer loads without
  an error and generates incoherent text; use `cpu`
  ([#553](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/553)).
- Windows x64 LiteRT-LM GPU needs `litert-lm-native` `v0.17.0-6` or later,
  which bundles `dxil.dll` and `dxcompiler.dll`. The pinned runtime includes
  them.
- Android NPU depends on the device SoC, the `.litertlm` bundle and the LiteRT
  dispatch libraries (`ModelParams.liteRtLmDispatchLibDir`). If native
  LiteRT-LM cannot create an NPU engine, use `cpu` or `gpu`.
- Some Vulkan drivers crash in the cooperative-matrix path; see
  [GPU crash or device loss](../troubleshooting/common-issues#gpu-crash-or-device-loss).
- WebGPU readiness depends on the browser, device, bridge assets and model
  size; see [WebGPU bridge](./webgpu-bridge).

## Pinned runtimes

| Runtime | Pinned release |
| --- | --- |
| llama.cpp native | `leehack/llamadart-native@v0.5.0` |
| LiteRT-LM native | `leehack/litert-lm-native@v0.17.0-6` |
| stable-diffusion.cpp native (opt-in, Preview) | `leehack/stable-diffusion-native@v0.2.0`, for [image generation](../guides/image-generation); see [Opt-in stable_diffusion runtime](./native-build-hooks#opt-in-stable_diffusion-runtime-experimental). Flutter iOS/macOS apps link its XCFramework through `llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter` |
| WebGPU bridge assets | `leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets`; see [Pinned bridge assets](./webgpu-bridge#pinned-bridge-assets) |

The native-assets hook currently pins `llamadart-native` tag
`v0.5.0` and
`litert-lm-native` release `v0.17.0-6` (`lib/src/hook/native_release_pins.dart`).
Apps can override the llama.cpp release with `llamadart_native_tag`, which
takes a `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-N`, `bNNNN`, `bNNNN-N` or
`bNNNN-llamadart.N` tag; nightly cores and rebuild counters reject leading
zeros. Build-hook overrides must always name an explicit tag; `latest` is
limited to maintainer synchronization and header/binding regeneration. Keys,
backend modules and local bundles:
[Native runtime configuration](./native-build-hooks).

Apps load the bridge assets themselves; see
[Add the bridge to your app](./webgpu-bridge#add-the-bridge-to-your-app).
