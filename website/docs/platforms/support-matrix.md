sidebar_label: Support matrix
description: Check which runtimes, backends and features llamadart supports on each platform, the known limitations, and the pinned runtime versions.
---

Use this page to check whether a runtime or feature works on a platform.
`LlamaBackend()` picks the runtime from the model format: LiteRT-LM bundles run
on LiteRT-LM, and GGUF files run on llama.cpp natively or on the WebGPU bridge
in a browser. Native targets read the file header; web targets use the URL's
extension or `ModelSource.format`
([How routing works](../guides/backend-selection#how-routing-works)). To choose backend modules or leave a
runtime out of the app, see [Native runtime configuration](./native-build-hooks).

## At a glance

Desktop source-CLI diagnostics can opt into
`dart run llamadart:doctor_native --runtime llama_cpp --json` (or
`litert_lm` / `stable_diffusion`) to check a declared artifact in an isolated
process. It checks selected symbols/static ABI markers, without device or model
initialization. This adds no runtime/platform/model capability: production loader
behavior, loaded release identity, emitted app assets and GPU/inference remain
unchecked. See [scope and limits](./diagnose-setup#isolated-native-check).

| Platform | GGUF backends | LiteRT-LM backends | Minimum OS | Speech to text | Text to speech | Decision models | Image generation (Preview) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android (arm64, x64) | CPU; Vulkan experimental, device-dependent; OpenCL opt-in | CPU, GPU, NPU | Not set by llamadart | Qwen3-ASR (GGUF); LiteRT-LM ASR | Qwen3-TTS | Untested | arm64 CPU; validated on Pixel 9 Pro, Galaxy S24 and A53 | Supported |
| iOS (arm64, arm64 simulator, x86_64 simulator) | CPU, Metal; on a simulator Metal returns incorrect output and `auto` uses the CPU ([#950](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/950)) | CPU, GPU; none on the x86_64 simulator | iOS 16.4 deployment target; LiteRT-LM run on a device only on iOS 18.3.2 | Qwen3-ASR (GGUF); LiteRT-LM ASR | Qwen3-TTS | Untested | Metal, iOS 16.4; validated on iPhone 16 Pro and SE 3; `vaeDirectConvolution: true` throws on Metal ([#1044](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1044)) | Supported |
| macOS (arm64, x86_64) | CPU, Metal; on x86_64, Rosetta included, `auto` uses the CPU because Metal returns garbled output on Intel Macs with AMD GPUs ([#1597](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1597)) | arm64: CPU, GPU; x86_64: none ([litert-lm-native#72](https://github.com/leehack/litert-lm-native/issues/72)) | macOS 14.0 (Flutter) | Qwen3-ASR (GGUF); LiteRT-LM ASR | Qwen3-TTS | Validated on Metal and CPU | Metal, macOS 13.3; validated on arm64 | Supported |
| Linux (arm64, x64) | CPU, Vulkan; BLAS opt-in; x64: CUDA, HIP opt-in | arm64: CPU; x64: CPU, explicit GPU | Not set by llamadart | Qwen3-ASR (GGUF); LiteRT-LM ASR | Qwen3-TTS | Untested | CPU or Vulkan; x64 needs AVX2; validated on x64 (CPU, NVIDIA L4) | Supported |
| Windows (arm64, x64) | CPU, Vulkan; BLAS opt-in; x64: CUDA opt-in | x64: CPU, explicit GPU; arm64: none | Not set by llamadart | Qwen3-ASR (GGUF); LiteRT-LM ASR on x64 | Qwen3-TTS | Untested | x64 CPU or Vulkan, needs AVX2 and the Visual C++ runtime; validated on Windows Server 2022 (CPU, NVIDIA L4) | Supported |
| Web | WebGPU, WebAssembly CPU | CPU, GPU through `@litert-lm/core` | Chrome 128, Firefox 129, Safari 17.4 (unvalidated, [#1025](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1025)) | Qwen3-ASR, WAV, MP3 or FLAC bytes | Qwen3-TTS, memory64 | Checked in headless Chromium on macOS | Not yet ([#969](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/969)) | Experimental |

On Windows, the llama.cpp and LiteRT-LM bundles ship the Visual C++ runtime
DLLs they need, so they need no Visual C++ Redistributable. The opt-in
`stable_diffusion` runtime does not ship them: machines that run it need the
latest Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable (x64), which stock Windows
Server lacks, and its load error names the DLLs that failed to load.

With the pinned bridge assets, Web speech-to-text and text-to-speech
cancellation is request-scoped, including queued STT generation and TTS startup
awaiting a capability probe.

Speech to text, text to speech and decision models are experimental. Image
generation is a Preview: its API is experimental and may change, and it needs
the opt-in `stable_diffusion` runtime. Per-platform requirements, validated
models, memory figures and the bounded recipes for tiling, editing, ControlNet,
hires fix, reference editing, seamless textures, module placement, the
conditioning cache, FP8 weights and local checkpoint sets are in
[Image generation](../guides/image-generation#support).

GGUF Qwen3-ASR accepts WAV, MP3 and FLAC; real-model checks cover all three on
native macOS and in headless Chromium. LiteRT-LM ASR is CPU-only streaming
recognition. Decision models run on llama.cpp and WebGPU only; on LiteRT-LM
`DecisionEngine.load` and `attach` throw `LlamaUnsupportedException`. See
[Speech to text](../guides/speech-to-text#choose-an-approach),
[Text to speech](../guides/text-to-speech) and
[Decision models](../guides/decision-models).

## Compute device

`ModelParams.device` (`ComputeDevice`) applies to every runtime. `auto` keeps
each runtime's default; `cpu`, `gpu` and `npu` run there or throw
`LlamaUnsupportedException`, never on another device. See
[Choosing the device](../guides/backend-selection#choosing-the-device).

| Runtime | `auto` | `gpu` | `npu` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native llama.cpp | Best GPU backend that loads, all layers; CPU without a GPU module or device, on Android and on an iOS simulator | Needs a GPU module and device; Vulkan on Android (experimental); Metal on an iOS simulator, where its output is incorrect | Throws |
| WebGPU (llama.cpp) | WebGPU when available, else the WebAssembly CPU runtime | Needs a WebGPU adapter and GPU layers after load; no CPU retry | Throws |
| Native LiteRT-LM | GPU on Android, iOS and macOS; CPU on Linux and Windows; a GPU engine that fails to start retries on the CPU with a warning | GPU backend on Android, iOS, macOS arm64, Linux x64 (Vulkan) and Windows x64 (Direct3D 12); a delegate that fails to start throws on first use | Android only |
| LiteRT-LM Web | WebGPU, without a probe | Needs a WebGPU adapter | Throws |
| Image generation | First GPU reported, else CPU | Needs a GPU; Android and the CPU builds have none | Throws |
| LiteRT-LM ASR | CPU | Not selectable | Not selectable |

The WebGPU bridge ignores negative `mainGpu` values, including with
`splitMode: ModelSplitMode.none`; they do not select the CPU as they do in
native llama.cpp. Explicit `gpu` still requires WebGPU after load.

Under `auto`, `gpuLayers: 0` or a CPU or BLAS `preferredBackend` selects the
CPU on both llama.cpp and LiteRT-LM, and a GPU `preferredBackend` (Vulkan,
Metal, CUDA, OpenCL or HIP) selects the LiteRT-LM GPU backend. On Linux x64
and Windows x64, the LiteRT-LM GPU backend is not CUDA; use `device: cpu` on
hosts without a hardware Vulkan driver. Windows arm64 has no LiteRT-LM
runtime. The deprecated `liteRtLmBackend` selector works until 1.0; an
unavailable choice there throws `LlamaModelException`.

`LlamaBackend()` rejects a LiteRT-LM model with `LlamaUnsupportedException`
before any download on macOS x86_64, Windows arm64 and the x86_64 iOS
simulator, which have no LiteRT-LM runtime, and for an explicit `device` the
platform's LiteRT-LM lacks, such as `gpu` on Linux arm64. The message names
the ABI. This applies when `ModelSource.format` or the file name says
`.litertlm`; a model known only from its file header is rejected when it
loads.

`await engine.checkLoad(model, params: params)` returns the same verdict as a
`LlamaLoadCheckReport` without downloading, reading a file or starting a
runtime: `unsupported` with the exception the load would throw, `deferred`
when only the file header can tell the format, `unknown` when the backend
cannot tell, as with `LlamaEngine(LiteRtLmBackend())`, and otherwise
`supported`, with the format, runtime and device the load would use. Like the
setup report, it is policy: native libraries, browser assets, `auto` device
selection, LoRA limits, download options and the file are checked by the load
([backend selection](../guides/backend-selection#check-a-load-before-it-runs)).

Dart-side chat-template rendering accepts Jinja `\xHH` string escapes on
native and web. Model architecture support depends on the pinned runtime; see
[chat templates](../guides/chat-template-and-parsing).

## Features by runtime

| Feature | Native llama.cpp | WebGPU | Native LiteRT-LM | LiteRT-LM Web |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Model-free setup report | Desktop IO only; publication policy, no native/model probe | Typed unsupported; no live browser check | Desktop IO only; publication policy, no native/model probe | Typed unsupported |
| Pre-load check | `npu` and options llama.cpp ignores rejected; native library and GPU unchecked | Options the Web runtime ignores rejected; WebGPU and bridge assets unchecked | No runtime on macOS x86_64, Windows arm64 or the x86_64 iOS simulator, and explicit devices the ABI lacks (`gpu` on Linux arm64), and embeddings off macOS arm64, iOS arm64 and Android arm64, rejected; `LlamaEngine(LiteRtLmBackend())` reports `unknown` | Options the Web runtime ignores, `npu` and the embedding engine rejected; browser runtime unchecked |
| LoRA | `ModelParams.loras` at load and `setLoraSource` at runtime, stacked and scaled; aLoRA rejected | Same, with bridge assets whose `getLoraAdapterCapabilities()` reports support ([llama-web-bridge#142](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/142)); otherwise rejected | One default-scale text adapter through `ModelParams.loras` at load | No |
| GPU device list and split (`gpuDevices`, `tensorSplit`) | Devices of one backend by `listGpuDevices` index, with proportions; validated on one Metal GPU and a Vulkan Tesla T4 (two-device paths with Mesa lavapipe as the second device); two-GPU hardware has no evidence ([#1528](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1528)) and CUDA is not hardware-qualified | No | No | No |
| Row split (`ModelSplitMode.row`) | Needs llama.cpp split buffer types, which no bundled backend provides; a load on a bundled GPU backend whose module loads (Metal, CUDA, HIP, Vulkan, OpenCL), with `GpuBackend.blas` or `GpuBackend.cpu`, with `auto` on Android, the iOS simulator and macOS x86_64 (which runs on the CPU), or that falls back to the CPU because the requested backend is missing or Vulkan is refused, throws `LlamaUnsupportedException` before the model loads, so use `ModelSplitMode.layer`; a bundled module that fails to load or finds no device loads row on the CPU instead ([#1576](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1576)) | No | No | No |
| Renamed legacy Qwen3 thinking switch | N/A: GGUF metadata | N/A: GGUF metadata | `chatTemplate: liteRtLmQwen3ChatTemplate`; requires native template setter | Canonical override throws at load: no template setter in `@litert-lm/core@0.18.0` |
| Thinking budget | Text-only, without speculative decoding, when the native reasoning-budget export resolves | Text-only, with bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `thinkingBudget` ([llama-web-bridge#144](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/144)); otherwise rejected | Native chat, without speculative decoding, on bundles whose first response channel is a thinking channel (Gemma 4); bounds that channel only; `0` and `forcedMessage` rejected | No |
| Strict `responseFormat` | Yes | Yes, without tools | macOS arm64 CPU, admitted canonical Qwen3 text model; scalar object schema subset, thinking disabled, no tools/media/speculation/caller stops | No |
| Lazy grammar | Yes | No: `grammar` applies from the first token, from `root` | No GBNF grammar | No GBNF grammar |
| Presence penalty | Yes | With bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `presencePenalty` ([llama-web-bridge#140](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/140)); otherwise rejects a non-zero value | Yes, without speculative decoding; counts only tokens of the current send | No: rejects a non-zero value |
| Min-P | Yes | With bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports `minP` ([llama-web-bridge#140](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/140)); otherwise rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value | No: rejects a non-zero value |
| Repetition `penalty` | Yes | Yes | A value other than the default, at least `1.0`, without speculative decoding; counts only tokens of the current send | No: rejects a value other than the default |
| Speculative decoding | Draft model, MTP, n-gram and DSpark strategies; external drafts require `draftModel`, in-file MTP requires an MTP head and `loadMtp`; `draftMicroBatchSize` sizes the draft context; recurrent/hybrid models reject nonzero rollback capacity | Same, with bridge assets whose `getCompletionCapabilities()` reports the strategy ([llama-web-bridge#153](https://github.com/leehack/llama-web-bridge/pull/153)); draft and n-gram cache paths are URLs, MTP uses the model's own layers, and `draftMicroBatchSize` is rejected; otherwise rejected | Runtime default or MTP, for bundles with a speculative drafter; `capabilities` reports the bundle's declaration | No |
| MoE expert placement and cache | `cpuMoeLayers` keeps experts in host memory; `moeCacheBytes` caches them on Metal and CUDA GPUs (qualified on Metal with OLMoE; CUDA has no hardware evidence); only `moeCacheBytes` throws `LlamaUnsupportedException` on Vulkan, other backends and tensor split, while `cpuMoeLayers` alone runs there | No | No | No |
| State persistence | Yes | Yes; WASMFS paths, lost on page reload | No | No |
| State identity (`stateIdentity`) | `llamadart-native` `v0.7.0-3+` | No: the bridge reports no build identity | No | No |
| Embeddings | Yes; one-pass attention and MEAN/CLS inputs must fit the physical micro-batch | Yes; rejects rerankers and over-long one-pass input as native does | CPU, explicit embedding engine; macOS arm64 and iOS arm64 qualified; Android arm64 verified on a Galaxy S24 without SME and on arm64 emulators; other platforms throw `LlamaUnsupportedException` at load ([#1367](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1367)) | Unsupported (parity gate) |
| Reranking | Rank-pooled GGUF only; explicit loaded-context probe, complete-pair limits and independent sequence batching | No | No | No |
| Text task helpers and Matryoshka | Opt-in EG2 text profile; CPU BF16 retrieval reference | Same Dart helpers on an available embedding engine; no new Web qualification | Same Dart helpers on an available CPU embedding engine; bundle requires independent retrieval qualification | Unsupported with the underlying embedding engine |
| Image/audio embeddings (`embedContent`) | EmbeddingGemma-2 + compatible projector, native v0.7.0-1; one complete micro-batch (BF16 qualified on CPU on macOS arm64, Linux x64, Windows x64, Android and iOS, and on macOS Metal; other GPU backends unqualified) | Explicit API-version-1 modality probe + compatible projector; EmbeddingGemma-2 qualified Chrome CPU wasm memory64 vs native CPU/Metal; repeated media batches qualified only on memory64 (wasm32 unqualified); hardware WebGPU unqualified | CPU; bundle processors on macOS arm64, iOS arm64 and Android arm64 (Galaxy S24 and emulators) | Unsupported (parity gate) |
| Next-token scores | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Generation-limit reporting | `length` for output or context limits | `length` with the bridge usage probe; cap cause unspecified | `length` for output or context limits | No |
| Per-request usage | `usage` on the final `create` chunk | Yes | No | No ([#725](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/725)) |
| Operation observers | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `llamaCpp` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `llamaCpp` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `liteRtLm` | Yes; after a load, `runtime` is `liteRtLm` |
| Multi-turn `ChatSession` | Yes | Yes | Yes | `LlamaBackend.withTextHistory()` or `LiteRtLmBackend.withTextHistory()` (existing defaults retain single-user-text): system/user/assistant text when the loaded runtime consumes `preface` and exposes `getHistory()` (`@litert-lm/core@0.18.0`); final user message required; model/browser qualification is separate |
| Deterministic session template time | `TemplateTimeChatSession`, Dart-rendered templates | Same Dart template path | Dart-side rendering only; runtime-owned template clock unchanged | No: runtime-owned clock; explicit template time rejected |
| Tool calling | Yes | Yes | Yes | No: tool declarations and tool messages throw |
| Canonical JSON Schema tools | Supported subset and selected formats | Non-lazy grammars only; other combinations rejected | No | No |
| Automatic `sendWithTools` / `completeWithTools` loop | Yes | Requires reliable runtime finish reporting | Yes | No: pinned runtime has no reliable termination cause; throws before generation |
| Multimodal | Image and audio with a projector | Image and audio with a projector URL | Image and audio files or bytes, when the bundle supports them | No |
| Video | No | No | No | No |
| Tool-result media | Images with a vision projector and a Hermes-style template (smoke-tested on macOS CPU and Metal with Qwen3.5-0.8B weights, a `qwen3vl_merger` projector and the Qwen3-VL template) | No | No | No |

Tool-result media are `LlamaToolResultContent.content` parts;
`LlamaEngineCapabilities.toolResultMedia` reports them. Other formats, audio,
video and URL-only images throw `LlamaUnsupportedException`, as do tool-role
image/audio parts and media alongside `LlamaToolResultContent` under any role
([tool-result media](../guides/tool-calling#tool-result-media)).

`LlamaEngine.supportsVideo` returns `false` on every runtime, and passing
`LlamaVideoContent` throws `LlamaUnsupportedException`. Web state paths point
into the bridge's WASMFS virtual filesystem; to keep state across reloads,
export and import it in app code. The pinned bridge assets report the WebGPU LoRA, thinking-budget,
presence-penalty, Min-P and speculative decoding capabilities; older assets
report none of them ([Older bridge assets](./webgpu-bridge#older-bridge-assets)).
After a load, `LlamaEngine.runtime` names the runtime and
`LlamaEngine.capabilities` reports the rows of this table for the loaded model:
media input, embeddings, next-token scores, multi-turn chat, tools, structured
output and grammars, sampling controls and speculative decoding. Guides:
