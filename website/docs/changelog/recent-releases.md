## 0.8.0

- Split Flutter Apple SwiftPM runtime linking into companion packages:
  `llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter` for GGUF/llama.cpp and
  `llamadart_litert_lm_flutter` for `.litertlm`/LiteRT-LM. The core package
  remains a native-assets package without Flutter plugin metadata; the
  companion package sources live under `packages/` in this repository.
- Changed unset or empty `llamadart_native_runtimes` to mean all available
  runtime families. Flutter iOS/macOS companion packages decide Apple SPM
  runtimes when present; other builds continue to use
  `llamadart_native_runtimes`.
- Added opt-in native `.litertlm` `ModelParams` for activation data type,
  prefill chunk size, parallel file-section loading, and Android NPU LiteRT
  dispatch library directory, forwarding the pinned LiteRT-LM `v0.13.1`
  engine-settings C APIs while keeping defaults unchanged.
- Extended the LiteRT-LM engine smoke tool with matching environment variables
  and documented the support decision for each candidate runtime knob.
- Kept LiteRT-LM web rejecting these native-only settings explicitly.
- Added llama.cpp MTP benchmark diagnostics and local smoke/benchmark tools so
  baseline-vs-MTP runs can report decode timing, draft/accepted token counts,
  draft verification timing, and acceptance rate.
- Added `SpeculativeDecodingConfig.mtp(draftModelPath: ...)` for llama.cpp
  external draft-model MTP sessions.
- Removed the Android Vulkan MTP allow-list dart define and the model-name
  based Android Vulkan acceleration shortcut. Vulkan MTP now runs only when
  callers explicitly request Vulkan plus MTP in runtime parameters.

## 0.7.2

- Added explicit pub.dev platform metadata for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, web,
  and Windows. This keeps the package listing aligned with the actual
  cross-platform runtime support even though Flutter plugin registration is
  only needed for Darwin app integration.

## 0.7.1

- Added Flutter iOS/macOS Swift Package Manager integration so Apple apps link
  pinned `leehack/llamadart-native` and `leehack/litert-lm-native`
  XCFramework artifacts through `darwin/llamadart/Package.swift`.
- Disabled the legacy hook-managed Apple bundle path for Flutter iOS/macOS
  builds, avoiding wrapper/framework `MinimumOSVersion` mismatches in App Store
  uploads.
- Raised the Flutter Apple runtime floors to iOS 16.4 and macOS 14.0 to match
  the published XCFramework artifacts.
- Kept Android native builds on both `llama_cpp` and `litert_lm` by default;
  iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows now default to `llama_cpp` only. Non-Android
  `.litertlm` apps should opt in with `llamadart_native_runtimes`.
- Added native release pin automation for Apple SPM checksums, excluded local
  SwiftPM artifact caches from pub archives, and hardened main-branch CI against
  Hugging Face tiny-model download rate limits.
- Compatibility note: no Dart API breaking changes. Flutter Apple apps must
  target iOS 16.4/macOS 14.0 or newer.

## 0.7.0

- Added LiteRT-LM as a first-class backend for native `.litertlm` bundles and
  single-turn web-compatible `.litertlm` URLs, alongside the existing
  llama.cpp/GGUF path.
- Added `ModelParams.liteRtLmBackend` so callers can select LiteRT-LM CPU, GPU,
  or Android NPU execution where the pinned runtime supports it.
- Added native LiteRT-LM tokenization, detokenization, log-level control,
  runtime metrics, cached Hugging Face loading, and package hook overrides for
  testing compatible native runtime sources.
- Added `GenerationParams.speculativeDecoding` for native LiteRT-LM and wired
  the benchmark app so speculative runs are reflected in metrics.
- Fixed Gemma 4 `.litertlm` thinking and tool calling with canonical templates,
  thought-channel parsing, reasoning suppression, and a filename-keyed template
  registry for Gemma and Qwen LiteRT-LM bundles.
- Fixed iOS `.litertlm` loading by resolving embedded `LiteRtLm` and
  `StreamProxy` frameworks from the app bundle.
- Added WebGPU mem64 selection through `ModelParams.preferMemory64` and
  `ModelParams.modelBytesHint` so large GGUF models such as Gemma 4 E2B can
  choose the 64-bit bridge core.
- Fixed chat-app web downloads, LiteRT-LM web loading/generation, unsupported
  token-count refreshes, and misleading LiteRT-LM load progress.
- Hardened native and LiteRT-LM cancellation/disposal, multimodal cleanup,
  parser correctness, grammar generation, model download timeouts, and partial
  download resume behavior.
- Added Gemma 4 benchmark tooling, GGUF chat-feature smoke coverage, and the
  WebGPU Gemma 4 mem64 E2E scenario.
- Updated README and website docs for backend choice, capability limits,
  platform support, package-size controls, benchmark results, model templates,
  and pinned runtime artifacts.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes for existing GGUF /
  llama.cpp callers. LiteRT-LM support is additive, with deprecated benchmark
  wrappers retained for compatibility; unsupported llama.cpp-only parameters are
  rejected for `.litertlm` loads instead of being silently ignored.

## 0.6.17

- Synced native hook pinning and regenerated bindings through
  `leehack/llamadart-native@b9371`, picking up llama.cpp `b9371`.
- Picked up the Apple mobile Metal stability fix that disables Metal residency
  sets on iOS/tvOS/visionOS native bundles, avoiding affected device
  context-creation failures such as `MTLLibraryErrorDomain Code=3`.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.17`; existing
  `0.6.16` callers remain compatible.

## 0.6.16

- Fixed native `getVramInfo()` so llama.cpp GPU-class backend devices can
  report free/total VRAM when available, with Windows split-bundle registry
  fallback handling for backend-device symbols.
- Improved browser recovery for large remote WebGPU model/projector loads by
  retrying wasm32 model-staging aborts with the wasm64 core before surfacing
  memory-pressure failures.
- Improved the runnable chat app's web remote-model startup path so model assets
  are prefetched into browser cache when available, browser `CacheStorage`
  failures fall back to direct network loading, and credentialed/signed model
  URLs skip persistent browser cache storage.
- Improved the runnable chat app's mobile download behavior so lifecycle pauses
  no longer deliberately cancel active foreground downloads; the app now lets
  short screen-lock/background interruptions continue when the OS permits and
  still keeps explicit pause/dispose cancellation paths.
- Added in-app and docs guidance for mobile large-model downloads, including
  resumable partial files, foreground Dart lifecycle limits, and the need for
  opt-in native background download/model-store integrations for robust
  cross-app GGUF management.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.16`; existing
  `0.6.15` callers remain compatible.

## 0.6.15

- Fixed GLM-OCR and other multimodal chat-template workarounds so image and
  audio content parts are preserved when tool-call normalization runs, system
  prompts are merged before leading media parts, and invalid tool-call
  serialization fails loudly instead of silently falling back to the wrong
  template shape.
- Added `tool/testing/run_local_e2e.dart` as a discovery and orchestration
  entry point for heavyweight local-only Dart E2E, Flutter device, and
  Web/Playwright smoke scenarios.
- Hardened the upstream llama.cpp chat/template E2E runner against current
  llama.cpp target renames, dynamic backend library lookup, and full
  `test-chat` server/mtmd build requirements.
- Documented that real-model/device/WebGPU scenarios remain skipped from
  default CI and should be opted into explicitly with `--list` and `--dry-run`
  first.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.15`; existing
  `0.6.14` callers remain compatible. The chat-template changes fix
  multimodal serialization behavior for affected templates, and the local E2E
  runner is additive.

## 0.6.14

- Updated the default WebGPU bridge asset pin to
  `leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets@v0.1.16` (llama.cpp `b9165`), picking up
  the published JS bridge build, TypeScript declaration asset, and refreshed
  bridge docs.
- Added WebGPU readiness guidance covering browser capability checks,
  cross-origin isolation, bridge asset/version diagnostics, fallback behavior,
  model/configuration pressure, and the Flutter Web real-model smoke path.
- Added `ModelDownloadController`, a dependency-free helper that turns
  `ModelDownloadManager` cache/download work into app-facing lifecycle states
  for resolving, cache checks, downloads, verification, ready, failed,
  cancelled, and retry flows.
- Wired the runnable chat app example through a `ModelDownloadManager` adapter
  so its model-management UI demonstrates the controller while preserving the
  example's multi-asset and web-cache service behavior.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.14`; the WebGPU
  bridge asset update and `ModelDownloadController` are additive, and existing
  `0.6.13` callers remain compatible.

## 0.6.13

- Added package-managed model source downloads and cache management:
  `ModelSource`, `ModelLoadOptions`, `ModelCachePolicy`, resolver targets,
  download/cache metadata, progress callbacks, cache inspection, removal,
  clearing, and age/size pruning.
- Added native/file-backed `DefaultModelDownloadManager` support for streaming
  HTTP downloads, `.part` files with atomic promotion, authenticated bearer and
  custom headers, cooperative cancellation, retry, HTTP Range resume, cache
  hit/refresh/cache-only/no-cache policies, SHA-256 verification, and persisted
  redacted metadata for signed URLs.
- Improved Hugging Face `hf://` ergonomics with `?revision=...` parsing for
  branch/ref names containing slashes, plus docs for private/gated bearer-token
  usage, separate `mmproj` assets, sharded-GGUF limitations, and redaction
  guarantees.
- Hardened download/cache correctness by serializing concurrent same-entry
  downloads, recovering missing or malformed cache metadata sidecars, treating
  mismatched byte-count/SHA-256 metadata as cache misses, and rejecting
  remote-only options for local `ModelSource.path(...)` inputs.
- Added `LlamaEngine.loadModelSource(...)` so local path sources keep using the
  existing native loader, remote HTTP(S)/Hugging Face sources download through
  the package-managed native cache before local loading, and URL-capable web
  backends keep using direct URL loading for simple unauthenticated requests.
- Added KV-cache state persistence APIs: `LlamaEngine.supportsStatePersistence`,
  `stateSaveFile(...)`, `stateLoadFile(...)`, backend support diagnostics, and
  WebGPU bridge forwarding for bridge assets `v0.1.15+`.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.13`; existing
  `loadModel(...)` callers are unchanged.

## 0.6.12

- Synced default WebGPU bridge asset pinning to
  `leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets@v0.1.14` (llama.cpp `b9016`) to match the
  native runtime pin.
- Picked up bridge-side Qwen UTF-8 streaming stabilization and multimodal
  fallback narrowing while preserving control-token output for parser consumers.
- Picked up the bridge-side BERT embedding thread-pool sizing fix so automatic
  thread selection does not exceed the compiled WebAssembly pthread pool.
- Forwarded native-compatible `ModelParams` load tuning knobs through the
  WebGPU bridge path, including sequence slots, flash attention, KV cache type,
  RoPE overrides, split mode, and main GPU.
- Matched native batch defaults on WebGPU so unset `batchSize` and
  `microBatchSize` use `n_batch = n_ctx` and `n_ubatch = n_batch`, avoiding
  first-embedding aborts for BERT-class/non-causal encoder models while
  preserving model-specific Qwen3.5-0.8B WebGPU safety tuning.
- Filtered backend-owned runtime dependencies during native asset bundling so
  CUDA runtime DLLs and OpenBLAS runtime libraries are emitted only when their
  owning backend module is selected, while unknown runtime libraries stay
  bundled for forward compatibility.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.12`.

## 0.6.11

- Synced native hook pinning and regenerated bindings through
  `leehack/llamadart-native@b8955`.
- Fixed Gemma 4 streaming so `<|channel>thought ... <channel|>` output is
  emitted as thinking deltas instead of content text, including when channel
  markers are split across streamed chunks.
- Tracked the chat app lockfile for stable generated Flutter plugin metadata in
  CI and release validation.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.11`.

## 0.6.10

- Synced native hook pinning and regenerated bindings through
  `leehack/llamadart-native@b8638`.
- Hardened multimodal prompt overflow handling so native failures surface as
  Dart exceptions, and reduced staged chat-app image size to a `384px` max edge
  to lower multimodal context pressure.
- Added built-in Gemma 4 template detection/render/parse support, including
  thinking and tool-call handling.
- Added runtime projector capability gating so multimodal flows and the chat app
  respect actual `supportsVision` / `supportsAudio` results instead of
  model-family assumptions.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.10`.

## 0.6.9

- Documented that iOS builds require a minimum deployment target of `16.4` or
  newer across the README, docs site, and example docs.
- Updated `example/chat_app` iOS Podfile and Runner project settings to use
  deployment target `16.4`.
- Honored `ggml_backend_score` during Android asset-based backend fallback so
  unsupported CPU variant libraries are skipped before initialization.
- Changed Android `auto` backend resolution to prefer CPU by default while
  keeping Vulkan available for explicit opt-in.
- Clarified that changing `hooks.user_defines` requires
  `flutter clean && flutter pub get` before rebuilding.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.9`.

## 0.6.8

- Synced native hook pinning and regenerated bindings to
  `leehack/llamadart-native@b8480`.
- Refreshed generated low-level FFI bindings to match the synced upstream
  headers.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.8`.

## 0.6.7

- Synced native hook pinning and regenerated bindings to
  `leehack/llamadart-native@b8373`.
- Hardened Linux bundle loading for packaged apps and improved versioned
  `libllamadart` dependency resolution.
- Fixed Hermes tool-call parsing when whitespace appears between `<tool_call>`
  and the JSON payload.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.7`.

## 0.6.6

- Synced native hook pin to `leehack/llamadart-native@b8216`.
- Updated default web bridge asset pinning to
  `leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets@v0.1.10` (llama.cpp `b8216`).
- Switched bundled Qwen3.5 example presets to Unsloth `Q4_K_M` GGUFs.
- Added native perf diagnostics chips in the chat app (`p_eval`, `eval`,
  `sample`, `reuse`) and Android-specific Qwen tuning guidance.
- Restored a targeted Android Vulkan fast path for local Qwen3.5 `0.8B` / `2B`
  / `4B` models while keeping CPU as the recommended Android preset for
  `0.8B` / `2B`.
- Fixed local web chat app bridge/runtime handling for Qwen prompt streaming and
  multimodal fallback behavior.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.6`.

## 0.6.5

- Added embedding APIs: `LlamaEngine.embed(...)` and
  `LlamaEngine.embedBatch(...)`.
- Added backend embedding capability interfaces for custom backend
  implementations.
- Added multi-sequence embedding batching support via
  `ModelParams.maxParallelSequences` (`n_seq_max`).
- Added native embedding benchmark tooling:
  `tool/testing/native_embedding_benchmark.dart` and
  `tool/testing/native_embedding_sweep.dart`.
- Added website docs for embeddings and updated basic-app docs with embedding
  examples.
- Added a Basic App SQLite vector retrieval example using
  `bin/llamadart_sqlite_vector_example.dart`.
- Updated default WebGPU bridge asset pinning to
  `leehack/llama-web-bridge-assets@v0.1.8`.
- Improved WebGPU runtime stability/tuning in chat app flows (backend switching,
  streaming smoothness, and multimodal regression gating).
- Added GPU-path multimodal image-size capping to reduce memory/runtime pressure
  on larger image inputs.
- Compatibility note: no public API breaking changes in `0.6.5`.

## 0.6.4

- Aligned multimodal projector offload with effective model-load settings,
  including CPU-only configurations.
- Added safer backend selection/discovery APIs and improved runtime backend
  status plus GPU-layer diagnostics accuracy.
- Improved web large-model handling with cache-prefetch download UX, bridge
  worker fallback paths, memory-pressure retries, and wasm64-core fallback
  wiring.
- Synced native hook tag to `b8157` and added Android arm64 CPU-profile and
  variant policy support with loader hardening.
