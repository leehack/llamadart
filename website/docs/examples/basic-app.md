description: Minimal Dart console apps for chat, embeddings, SQLite vector retrieval, decision models and image generation, the quickest way to see the core llamadart API.

Path: `example/basic_app` · Platforms: Dart console on macOS, Linux and
Windows · First-run download: `Qwen3.5-0.8B-Q4_K_M.gguf` (533 MB)

Dart console apps that show the core API: chat, embeddings, vector retrieval,
decision models and image generation, without Flutter.

## Run

```bash
cd example/basic_app
dart pub get
dart run
```

Variants:

```bash
# Embeddings (downloads embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0.gguf, 334 MB)
dart run bin/llamadart_embedding_example.dart -i "hello world" -i "rag"

# Retrieval: embeddings stored and searched in SQLite with sqlite_vector
dart run bin/llamadart_sqlite_vector_example.dart \
  -q "How do I improve embedding throughput?" \
  -d "Increase maxParallelSequences for wider embedding batches." \
  -d "Tune batchSize and ubatchSize together."

# Decision model: triage a support ticket
# (downloads laya-Q8_0.gguf, 421 MB, and laya-head.safetensors, 106 MB)
dart run bin/llamadart_decision_example.dart

# Image generation: write a PNG with SDXS (downloads the stable_diffusion
# runtime and the preset's pinned sdxs-512-tinySDdistilled_Q8_0.gguf,
# 683 MB); Ctrl-C cancels
dart run bin/llamadart_image_example.dart -p "a red fox in autumn leaves"
```

## What it demonstrates

- Loading a model from an `hf://` source into the shared cache, streaming a
  chat reply, and disposing the engine
  ([Generation and streaming](../guides/generation-and-streaming)).
- LoRA adapters (`--lora`), GBNF-constrained output (`--grammar`) and a
  sample tool call (`--tool-test`) in the chat CLI
  ([LoRA adapters](../guides/lora-adapters),
  [Tool calling](../guides/tool-calling)).
- Single and batched embeddings, and query-versus-candidate probes
  ([Embeddings](../guides/embeddings)).
- Local retrieval with SQLite vector search, exact or quantized, with a
  recall check against exact search ([Embeddings](../guides/embeddings)).
- Typed choice, score and yes/no answers from a decision model with
  `ChoiceKey.enumOf`, `ScoreKey.of`, `NoulKey.of` and `answerOf`
  ([Decision models](../guides/decision-models#typed-questions)).
- Experimental image generation with SDXS, SD-Turbo, or the desktop
  presets (SDXL-Lightning, FLUX.1-schnell, SD 3.5 Large Turbo, Z-Image-Turbo)
  from the library's pinned downloads: file and phase progress,
  Ctrl-C cancellation and PNG output, with the `stable_diffusion` runtime
  opted in through the example's `pubspec.yaml`
  ([Image generation](../guides/image-generation)).

## Test

```bash
cd example/basic_app
dart test
```

Full options: every flag of the five CLIs, the retrieval result fields and
the decision-model head options are in the
