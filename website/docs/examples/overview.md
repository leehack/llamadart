title: Examples Overview
---

The repository ships multiple examples for different integration styles.

## Example catalog

- [Basic App](./basic-app): minimal Dart console usage.
- [Chat App](./chat-app): Flutter UI with settings and streaming.
- [llamadart CLI](./llamadart-cli): llama.cpp-style command-line workflow.
- [llamadart Server](./llamadart-server): OpenAI-compatible local HTTP server.
- [TUI Coding Agent](./tui-coding-agent): nocterm-based coding assistant flow.

## Which one should I start with?

- Learn API surface first: start with Basic App.
- Learn local embedding flows quickly: use Basic App embedding CLI.
- Learn local embedding + vector database retrieval: use Basic App SQLite vector CLI.
- Build a product UI: start with Chat App.
- Need terminal workflow parity: start with llama CLI.
- Need HTTP integration for tools/agents: start with llamadart Server.
- Need an interactive coding-agent terminal UI: start with TUI Coding Agent.

## Global example requirements

- Dart SDK `>= 3.10.7`
- Flutter SDK `>= 3.38.0` for Flutter examples
- Flutter Apple example builds require deployment targets of iOS `16.4` or
  macOS `14.0` or newer
- Internet on first run (runtime bundle resolution)
- The Chat App opts into both `llama_cpp` and `litert_lm` native runtime
  families because it demonstrates GGUF and `.litertlm` models. The smaller
  examples stay on the package defaults.
