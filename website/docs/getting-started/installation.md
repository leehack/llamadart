sidebar_label: Installation
description: Add llamadart to a Dart or Flutter app, set up Apple and web targets, verify the install, and customize the prebuilt native runtimes.
---

## Requirements

- Dart SDK `>= 3.10.7`
- Flutter SDK `>= 3.38.0` (if you build Flutter apps)
- Flutter iOS apps: deployment target `16.4` or newer
- Flutter macOS apps: deployment target `14.0` or newer
- Windows: the latest Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable for the app's
  architecture (x64 or arm64) on every machine that runs the app, at least as
  new as the build tools of the bundled DLLs. Stock Windows Server lacks it;
  see
  [Native library won't load](../troubleshooting/common-issues#llamacpp-runtime-could-not-be-loaded-on-windows-x64).

## Add the package

```yaml
dependencies:
  llamadart: ^0.12.1
```

Then resolve packages:

```bash
dart pub get
# or
flutter pub get
```

## Flutter iOS and macOS setup

Set the app's deployment target before running: iOS `16.4` or newer, macOS
`14.0` or newer. In Xcode, set `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 16.4` or
`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 14.0` for the Runner configurations. An iOS app that
still uses CocoaPods also needs the Podfile platform:

```ruby
platform :ios, '16.4'
```

The deployment target is a build requirement, not a tested floor for every
runtime. LiteRT-LM has run on a device only on iOS 18.3.2; see
[Known limitations](../platforms/support-matrix#known-limitations).

To link the Apple XCFrameworks through Swift Package Manager, add the runtime
companion packages you need:

```yaml
dependencies:
  llamadart: ^0.12.1
  llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter: ^0.0.22 # GGUF / llama.cpp
  llamadart_litert_lm_flutter: ^0.0.15 # Apple .litertlm / LiteRT-LM targets
  llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter: ^0.0.3 # Apple image generation, opt-in
```

Pair companion `0.0.22` with core `0.12.1` and `0.12.0`; keep `0.0.21` with
core `0.11.1` and `0.11.0`. The build checks the resolved llama.cpp and stable_diffusion companions' runtime pins and fails on
a mismatch or on an unverified local `Artifacts` override; resolve the
matching companion and rerun `flutter pub get`. On macOS,
`llamadart_litert_lm_flutter` links and embeds the complete LiteRT-LM runtime,
including the GPU accelerators. The build uses it only when the resolved
companion's `Package.swift` is the one this core release expects; any other
companion keeps macOS LiteRT-LM in the hook cache with a build warning, and the
app then needs the [build phase below](#flutter-macos-litert-lm-build-phase).

The companion's macOS `LiteRt`, WebGPU accelerator and sampler, and Dawn
libraries are published for arm64 only, so a universal
`flutter build macos` prints
`ld: warning: ignoring file ... found architecture 'arm64', required
architecture 'x86_64'` for each of them. The arm64-only build that
[Intel Macs](#intel-macs) describes removes those warnings.

Pair `llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter` `0.0.3` with core `0.12.1` and
`0.12.0`. Keep `0.0.2` with core `0.11.1` and `0.11.0`, and `0.0.1` with core
`0.10.0`; older cores, including `0.9.x`, ignore it. Adding it opts iOS and
macOS builds into the image generation runtime (about 37 MB per Apple
target) on its own and leaves the other
runtimes on their current path, so leave it out unless the app uses
`ImageGenerationEngine`. An app that uses image generation without it gets the
hook-bundled runtime, whose iOS framework `MinimumOSVersion` App Store Connect
rejects; only Xcode and `xcodebuild` show the build warning about it.

An app bound for the App Store should use the companion for each runtime it
ships, because an Apple privacy manifest reaches an app inside a companion's
XCFramework and never through the hook path. The llama.cpp XCFramework has one
from `llamadart-native` `v0.5.0-1`, and the stable_diffusion one from
`stable-diffusion-native` `v0.2.0-1`.
An app that runs llama.cpp or stable_diffusion on the hook path, or whose
embedded `llama.framework` or `stable_diffusion.framework` has no
`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, declares the runtime's required-reason API use in its
own `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`. The LiteRT-LM iOS frameworks have their own
manifests from `litert-lm-native` `v0.17.0-8`; an app that runs LiteRT-LM on
the hook path, or whose embedded LiteRT-LM frameworks have none, declares that
runtime's three categories itself. Copy the categories and codes from
[Apple privacy manifest](../platforms/native-build-hooks#apple-privacy-manifest).

### Intel Macs

LiteRT-LM `v0.18.0` does not load on x86_64 macOS ([litert-lm-native#72](https://github.com/leehack/litert-lm-native/issues/72)): its x86_64
`LiteRtLm` binary needs Gemma constraint-provider symbols that no x86_64
library provides. A Flutter macOS app that depends on
`llamadart_litert_lm_flutter` links that binary, so the whole app, llama.cpp
included, dies at launch on an Intel Mac or under Rosetta with
`symbol not found in flat namespace '_LiteRtLmGemmaModelConstraintProvider_Destroy'`.
A Dart program, or a Flutter app without the companion, starts but cannot load
LiteRT-LM on x86_64: the hook's x86_64 `libLiteRtLm.dylib` fails `dlopen`
with the same message on first LiteRT-LM use.

Until that is fixed, build Flutter macOS apps that use the companion for arm64
only. Add this line to `macos/Runner/Configs/Release.xcconfig`, which the
Release and Profile configurations use:

```
EXCLUDED_ARCHS = x86_64
```

Flutter passes it to `xcodebuild`, so the executable, `App.framework` and the
Swift packages build for arm64 only, and an Intel Mac refuses to open the app
instead of crashing it. Debug builds already target only the build Mac's
architecture. For a one-off build, `FLUTTER_MACOS_ARM64_ONLY=true flutter build
macos` has the same effect; `flutter config --enable-macos-arm64-only` turns it
on for every project on the machine.

### Flutter macOS LiteRT-LM build phase

A Flutter macOS app gets the LiteRT-LM runtime in its bundle only from a
`llamadart_litert_lm_flutter` that matches the core. With llamadart `0.12.0`
and earlier, with companion `0.0.14` and earlier, or without the companion,
the build hook leaves the libraries in its cache inside the resolved
`llamadart` package, and the app loads them from there only when it runs unsandboxed, on
the build machine, from inside the project. Under the App Sandbox, which
`flutter create` turns on, and in any copied or distributed app, the first
LiteRT-LM generation on CPU or GPU throws
`Failed to load dynamic library 'libLiteRt.dylib'`, or
`'libLiteRtMetalAccelerator.dylib'` with llamadart `0.12.0` and a newer
companion
([#1029](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/1029)). llama.cpp is not
affected.

Upgrade the core and the companion together. Until then, add a build phase
that copies the runtime into the app:

1. Open `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode and select the **Runner** target.
2. In **Build Phases**, add a **New Run Script Phase** and drag it to the end
   of the list, after **Bundle Framework** and Flutter's own script phase.
3. Set **Shell** to `/bin/bash`, clear **Based on dependency analysis**, and
   paste:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
config=
dir="$PROJECT_DIR"
while [ "$dir" != / ]; do
  if [ -f "$dir/.dart_tool/package_config.json" ]; then
    config="$dir/.dart_tool/package_config.json"
    break
  fi
  dir="$(dirname "$dir")"
done
if [ -z "$config" ]; then
  echo "error: no .dart_tool/package_config.json above $PROJECT_DIR; run flutter pub get" >&2
  exit 1
fi
root=
count="$(plutil -extract packages raw -o - "$config")"
for ((i = 0; i < count; i++)); do
  if [ "$(plutil -extract "packages.$i.name" raw -o - "$config")" = llamadart ]; then
    root="$(plutil -extract "packages.$i.rootUri" raw -o - "$config")"
    break
  fi
done
if [ -z "$root" ]; then
  echo "error: llamadart is not resolved in $config" >&2
  exit 1
fi
case "$root" in
  file://*) root="${root#file://}" ;;
  *) root="$(dirname "$config")/$root" ;;
esac
root="$(printf '%b' "${root//%/\\x}")"
bash "$root/tool/macos_litert_lm_prepare_app.sh" "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$WRAPPER_NAME"
```

The script finds the resolved `llamadart` package through
`.dart_tool/package_config.json`, so it works for hosted, path and git
dependencies and in pub workspaces, and runs that package's
`tool/macos_litert_lm_prepare_app.sh`. That script copies the libraries for
the build Mac's architecture only into `Contents/Frameworks/LiteRtLmRuntime`
and signs them with the build's signing identity. Once the companion embeds
the runtime, the script detects it and copies nothing, so the phase can be
removed.

## Web

Web apps must load the WebGPU bridge script in their `web/index.html`; the
package does not inject it. See
[Add the bridge to your app](../platforms/webgpu-bridge#add-the-bridge-to-your-app).

## AI agent skills

The package ships [agent skills](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-skills)
that teach coding agents llamadart's APIs. After `pub get`, run this from your
app's root and pick the skills and agent to install them for:

```bash
dart run skills@ get
```

Rerun it after upgrading llamadart to update the installed skills.

## Verify it works

Run the [Quickstart](./quickstart) example with `maxTokens: 1`. If the runtime
initializes and the model loads, your setup is complete.

## What happens on first build

On the first `dart run` / `flutter run` for a native target, `llamadart`:

1. Detects platform and architecture.
2. Resolves matching runtime artifacts from `leehack/llamadart-native` and
   `leehack/litert-lm-native`.
3. Wires them into your app through native assets. Flutter iOS builds use
   SwiftPM-linked XCFrameworks when the matching companion packages are present;
   without the LiteRT-LM companion, Flutter macOS LiteRT-LM keeps its libraries
   in the hook cache and needs the
   [build phase](#flutter-macos-litert-lm-build-phase) in the app. The
   opt-in image generation runtime comes from `leehack/stable-diffusion-native`
   the same way.

No local C++ toolchain setup is required for consumers.

## Customize native runtimes

Native builds bundle every available runtime family. To ship only one model
format, or to test another native build, set `hooks.user_defines` in your
`pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  user_defines:
    llamadart:
      llamadart_native_runtimes: [llama_cpp] # or [litert_lm]
      # Compatibility testing only; omit to use the tested pin.
      # llamadart_native_tag: v0.6.0-3
```

A `llamadart_native_backends` request that names any backend module the target
bundle lacks is discarded whole: the hook logs a warning and bundles the
defaults instead.

Override tags name a `leehack/llamadart-native` release: stable
`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, stable wrapper rebuilds `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-N`,
historical `bNNNN`, nightly wrapper rebuilds `bNNNN-N`, or consume-only
`bNNNN-llamadart.N`. Nightly cores are written without leading zeros, and
rebuild counters start at 1. Build-hook overrides must always name an explicit
tag; `latest` is limited to maintainer synchronization and header/binding
regeneration. An override does not regenerate the Dart bindings, so its
binary must stay ABI-compatible with the default
`leehack/llamadart-native@v0.6.0-3` runtime.
