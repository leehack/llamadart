## Apple companion compatibility

The hook binds the complete maintained SwiftPM template, normalizing only its
release tag, checksum and CRLF line endings. A companion manifest code change
requires a reviewed hook contract update; copied tag declarations cannot
authorize alternate framework URLs or target code.

Apple llama.cpp and stable_diffusion companion selection validates the
**resolved** package from the consumer/workspace `package_config.json`,
including path and dependency overrides. Its package identity and maintained
SwiftPM native pin must match the core hook pin (`llamaCppTag` or
`stableDiffusionReleaseTag`) before any in-process native asset is emitted.
Each companion has its own template hash in `hook/build.dart`. Updating a
declared dependency constraint alone is insufficient: rerun `flutter pub get`
and resolve the matching companion. Core native tag/path/backend overrides do
not replace SwiftPM frameworks and cannot bypass this check.

Local `Artifacts` overrides in that companion are rejected because their ABI
provenance is unverified. Remove the override and use the pinned remote
framework. Non-Apple native-assets and LiteRT selection are unchanged.

## Native sync flow

When native behavior or bindings need updates:

1. Make and release changes in `llamadart-native`, `litert-lm-native` or
   `stable-diffusion-native` first.
2. Sync native version and bindings in this repo.
3. Sync matching Apple SPM pins in the Flutter runtime companion packages under
   `packages/` when Apple XCFramework releases changed.

The invariant is that core native-assets builds and Flutter Apple companion
Swift Package Manager builds should resolve compatible bridge runtime releases.
Do not point the core hook at `leehack/*-native` artifacts while companion
`Package.swift` files point at unrelated Apple binaries; that creates different
bridge behavior between pure Dart/macOS fallback and Flutter Apple builds.

| Runtime | Core native-assets pin | Apple SPM companion pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| llama.cpp / GGUF | `lib/src/hook/native_release_pins.dart` `llamaCppTag`, default repository `leehack/llamadart-native` | `packages/llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter/.../Package.swift` binary target URL/checksum |
| LiteRT-LM / `.litertlm` | `lib/src/hook/native_release_pins.dart` `liteRtLmReleaseTag` and per-bundle checksums, repository `leehack/litert-lm-native` | `packages/llamadart_litert_lm_flutter/.../Package.swift` binary target URLs/checksums |
| stable-diffusion.cpp (opt-in `stable_diffusion`) | `lib/src/hook/native_release_pins.dart` `stableDiffusionReleaseTag` and per-bundle checksums, repository `leehack/stable-diffusion-native` | `packages/llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter/.../Package.swift` binary target URL/checksum |

Preferred in-repo workflow:

- `.github/workflows/sync_native_bindings.yml`

That workflow syncs llama.cpp headers, regenerates ffigen bindings, updates the
native hook pins, updates companion package SPM pins, refreshes current
README/website native pin docs, and opens a PR. It does not bump companion
package versions by default. Use the sync script's explicit
`--bump-companion-versions` option only when the same change intentionally
prepares companion package releases. The `native_tag` input controls the
`llamadart-native` release. Stable distribution tags use strict
`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`; historical/nightly artifacts remain consumable through an
explicit `bNNNN` tag. New nightly wrapper releases use `bNNNN-N`; existing
`bNNNN-llamadart.N` artifacts remain explicit consumption-only inputs. `latest`
accepts only an unsuffixed `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` regardless of GitHub metadata.
New wrapper and nightly releases are GitHub prereleases and must be named
explicitly. Immutable historical `bNNNN` and `bNNNN-llamadart.N` artifacts may
retain older `prerelease=false` metadata, but remain explicit compatibility
inputs. Nightly cores use canonical decimal spelling (`b0` or a nonzero first
digit), and rebuild counters start at 1 without leading zeros.
The `litert_lm_tag` input defaults to `keep`; set it to a
`litert-lm-native` tag or `latest` only when the LiteRT-LM native release should
move in the same PR.

For a wrapper-only rebuild of upstream stable `vM.m.p`, the native release uses
`vM.m.p-N`: for example upstream `v0.2.0` maps to native `v0.2.0-1`, then
`v0.2.0-2`. The native release policy orders that sequence after `v0.2.0` and
before upstream `v0.2.1`, despite generic SemVer prerelease ordering. The suffix
belongs only to `native_release_tag`; `llama_cpp_tag`/`llama_cpp_ref` in
`assets.json` must remain the exact unsuffixed upstream prefix. GitHub classifies
the rebuild as a prerelease, so automatic `latest` discovery must not select it.

LiteRT-LM native tags follow four writable forms: stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`,
stable rebuild `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-N`, development `g<12hex>`, and development
rebuild `g<12hex>-N`. Historical `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-native.N` tags remain
explicitly consumable but read-only. The sync tool validates schema 2 release,
upstream, native commit, ABI/capability, platform, digest, and real-model
evidence fields before it prepares changes for a new compact or development tag.
The release artifact tag is stored separately from the runtime/cache version,
so development assets use `g<sha>` directly and never synthesize `vg<sha>` URLs.
Schema 1 manifests remain accepted only when the downloaded bytes, GitHub asset
digest, and immutable tag commit match the checked-in historical allowlist.

For schema 2, Apple target selection follows the per-platform owner inventory.
Sync removes a formerly required iOS Gemma constraint-provider target from a
modern Swift manifest when the new iOS bundles no longer require it. An optional
provider XCFramework asset alone does not add an iOS dependency. The separate
macOS compatibility target and all required macOS provider/runtime files remain
in the generated inventories. Releases whose iOS bundles still require the
provider retain it; malformed or ambiguous Swift target layouts fail before
pin files are replaced. Updating the sync tool does not change the current pins
or publish a runtime.

Changing between stable and development channels requires
`--allow-litert-channel-transition`; changing between two distinct `g<sha>`
lines requires `--allow-litert-development-line-transition`. Both flags default
off and represent explicit review of the owner-validated ancestry evidence.
Entering a newer stable version at a qualified rebuild instead of its base
release requires `--allow-litert-stable-rebuild-entry`. Use this only after
reviewing the corrected owner artifact; full manifest validation still applies.
This flag does not permit rollbacks, same-version rebuild skips, or channel
changes. For example, a qualified `v0.17.0-1` can replace `v0.16.0-native.2`
without first consuming the superseded `v0.17.0` artifact.
Legacy and compact tags with the same version and rebuild ordinal are aliases
and are rejected. All pin edits are staged before a recoverable multi-file
replacement, so a partial filesystem failure restores every prior pin.

Local fallback:

```bash
python3 tool/native/sync_native_release_pins.py \
  --llama-cpp-tag latest \
  --litert-lm-tag keep \
  --dry-run
tool/native/sync_native_headers_and_bindings.sh --tag latest
python3 tool/native/sync_native_release_pins.py \
  --llama-cpp-tag latest \
  --litert-lm-tag keep
```

The pin sync rejects same-channel rollback and release/manifest version skew.
After the default pin moves to the stable channel, an intentional compatibility
test against a `bNNNN`, `bNNNN-N`, or legacy `bNNNN-llamadart.N` artifact must
name that tag and pass `--allow-legacy-tag`; the compatibility-named flag does
not allow rollback within either channel. The manual sync workflow exposes the
same gate as its `allow_nightly_channel` checkbox and leaves it disabled by
default.
Stable releases must provide `assets.json`, `SHA256SUMS`, every supported bundle,
and hook contract version 1. New stable or nightly wrapper forms require
`assets.json`, `native_release_tag`, and the retained `tag` compatibility alias;
older base or legacy-wrapper manifests with only `tag` remain valid.
Manifest checksums must agree with both `SHA256SUMS` and GitHub release asset
digests before any pin files are written.
Re-syncing the exact current tag remains idempotent for recovery and validation;
the owning native release workflow is responsible for rejecting publication
collisions.

After sync, run analyze/tests/docs checks before merge. For Apple SPM pin
changes, verify the companion package changes under `packages/`, then run at
least one Flutter iOS build and one macOS build with those packages enabled.
Inspect the packaged frameworks to confirm the expected native release artifacts
are present.

App overrides through `llamadart_native_tag` accept the same tag forms as the
sync, never `latest`, and do not regenerate bindings. The symbols and wrapper
fixes a replacement runtime must provide are listed in
[Override the llama.cpp release](../platforms/native-build-hooks#override-the-llamacpp-release).

## stable_diffusion runtime sync

The opt-in `stable_diffusion` runtime is not wired into
`sync_native_bindings.yml` yet; sync it by hand. `stable-diffusion-native`
tags are `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, or `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-N` for a rebuild; name
the tag explicitly, since `latest` skips GitHub prereleases.

```bash
python3 tool/native/sync_native_release_pins.py \
  --stable-diffusion-tag v0.2.0-2 \
  --dry-run
python3 tool/native/sync_native_release_pins.py \
  --stable-diffusion-tag v0.2.0-2
python3 tool/native/sync_stable_diffusion_bindings.py
```

The pin sync reads the release `manifest.json`, requires it to match its GitHub
asset digest, requires every runtime archive's manifest SHA-256 to match its
GitHub digest, and rewrites `stableDiffusionReleaseTag`,
`stableDiffusionVersion` and each pinned bundle's checksum and library. It
also rewrites the `llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter` `Package.swift` tag and
checksum from the manifest's `xcframework` artifact, after checking that
artifact against its GitHub digest, and records the pin in the companion
README and CHANGELOG. It does not touch other docs: update the pin in
`website/docs/platforms/support-matrix.md` by hand. It
fails if a pinned bundle is no longer published or the tag moves backwards,
and only notes new targets: a new target needs a `StableDiffusionBundleSpec`
and a `stableDiffusionBundleForNativeBundle` mapping by hand.

`sync_stable_diffusion_bindings.py` downloads the pinned `linux-x64` archive
(or takes `--archive`), checks it against the pin, stages
`include/stable-diffusion.h` and `include/sd_dart_wrapper.h` under
`.dart_tool/llamadart/ffigen_headers_stable_diffusion/`, and regenerates
`lib/src/backends/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_bindings.dart` with
`ffigen_stable_diffusion.yaml`. The bindings resolve the library through the
`package:llamadart/stable_diffusion` native-asset id that the hook emits.
That config leaves five `sd_dart_exit_` functions unbound and marks
`sd_dart_progress_read` as the only leaf call. A new `sd_dart_` function the
image worker calls also goes into `StableDiffusionCalls`, whose probe decides
whether the runtime is supported, or, when llamadart also has to run on a
runtime without it, into one of its optional groups, which is `null` there
([exit teardown](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/blob/main/doc/llama_cpp_exit_teardown.md#image-models)).

After a sync, run
`dart test --run-skipped -t local-only test/integration/stable_diffusion_runtime_hook_test.dart`
on macOS: it builds a throwaway consumer against the new pin and probes the
runtime it bundles. Then run the `image-generation-smoke` and
`image-exit-teardown` rows of `doc/testing_matrix.md`.

## Native version update checklist

Use this checklist in native sync PRs:

- Confirm `llamadart-native`, `litert-lm-native` or `stable-diffusion-native`
  has published the target release and the required per-platform
  native-assets archives.
- For a stable-channel llama.cpp native sync, confirm the release tag is an
  upstream-aligned `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or an explicitly selected wrapper rebuild,
  `assets.json` records the correct distinct native/upstream tags and hook
  contract version 1, and its artifact checksums match the release assets.
- For LiteRT-LM schema 2 releases, confirm the manifest's exact upstream and
  native commits, ABI/capabilities, platform list, artifact digests, and
  Linux/Windows real-model smoke evidence before changing any pin.
- Confirm the schema-2 bytes match the owner-generated fixture contract under
  `tool/native/fixtures/`; do not add a downstream-only manifest variant.
- Confirm the same release provides Apple SPM-compatible XCFramework zip
  artifacts when companion package pins should move.
- Update `lib/src/hook/native_release_pins.dart` native pins with
  `.github/workflows/sync_native_bindings.yml` or
  `tool/native/sync_native_release_pins.py`.
- Update companion package `Package.swift` URL/checksum pins under `packages/`
  when Apple XCFramework releases changed.
- Bump changed companion package versions only when that PR is intentionally
  preparing companion package releases; otherwise leave companion pub versions
  unchanged and let release prep own the version bump.
- Ensure each changed companion package README and CHANGELOG native-pin note
  names the new native repo tag when package contents change.
- Regenerate `lib/src/backends/llama_cpp/bindings.dart` whenever the
  `llamadart-native` header bundle changed. Only
  `package:llamadart/llama_cpp_bindings.dart` exports it, outside semantic
  versioning, so a regeneration never changes the app API.
- Update public docs that mention the pinned native versions or source table.

## Companion package release handoff

The repository LiteRT-LM pin is `v0.17.0-8`; companion `0.0.13` ships its
provider-free iOS SwiftPM manifest and the frameworks' Apple privacy
manifests, and companion `0.0.12` retains `v0.17.0-6`. The iOS artifacts
meet the declared 16.4 deployment floor, but runtime execution at 16.4 remains
unqualified; keep [#831](https://github.com/leehack/llamadart/issues/831) open.

Native sync PRs can leave the repository in a state where the companion package
source under `packages/` is ready, but the corresponding pub.dev package version
does not exist yet. That is expected before merge, but it must be resolved before
tagging the next core `llamadart` release.

For every companion package whose `pubspec.yaml` version changed, or whose
version is newly referenced by current install docs:

1. Confirm the `Package.swift` binary targets point at published native GitHub
   release assets and that the pinned checksums match those assets.
2. Merge the sync/release-prep PR first. The PR itself must not publish the
   companion or core package.
3. After merge, `release_on_prep_merge.yml` uses the release-prep PR merge as
   the publishing approval boundary and pushes each missing package-specific
   companion tag:
   `llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter-v{{version}}`,
   `llamadart_litert_lm_flutter-v{{version}}` or
   `llamadart_stable_diffusion_flutter-v{{version}}`. A package's first
   version must already be published by hand; see
   [Release workflow](./release-workflow).
4. Wait for `publish_companion_pubdev.yml` to pass.
5. Verify the version URL on pub.dev, for example
   `https://pub.dev/api/packages/llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter/versions/{{version}}`.
6. Only after the companion version is live, the automation pushes the core
   `vX.Y.Z` release tag that documents or depends on that companion version.

## Web bridge asset sync flow

When web bridge runtime behavior changes:

1. Update and release in `llama-web-bridge`.
2. Publish assets in `llama-web-bridge-assets`.
3. Update pinned assets in this repo.

Fetch pinned assets for local app web files:

```bash
WEBGPU_BRIDGE_ASSETS_TAG=<tag> ./scripts/fetch_webgpu_bridge_assets.sh
```

## Validation after sync

Use the contributor matrix to choose exact rows and record PR evidence:

```bash
dart run tool/testing/test_matrix.dart --list
```

- Native: model load/generation smoke checks on relevant platforms.
- Web: bridge load/fallback checks in `example/chat_app`.
- Docs: ensure version/platform notes match newly pinned runtime behavior.
