title: Release Checklist
description: Use this checklist to cut a llamadart release, snapshot docs, and verify the published artifacts afterward.

Use this checklist when releasing `llamadart`.

## 1. Pre-release validation

```bash
# Print release-tier rows for evidence planning; this does not run validation.
dart run tool/testing/test_matrix.dart --tier release
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
dart analyze
dart test
dart run tool/testing/verify_release_docs_versions.dart
./tool/docs/build_site.sh
./tool/docs/validate_links.sh
```

Ensure migration/changelog docs reflect behavior in the release branch.

Before publishing a release that changes native runtime pins, verify native
version alignment:

- `hook/build.dart` native-assets pins and companion package `Package.swift`
  Apple SPM pins should reference compatible native repo releases.
- Companion package README and CHANGELOG files should name the native repo tags
  they publish.
- `llamadart-native` owns llama.cpp bridge artifacts for native-assets and
  Apple SPM-compatible companion packages.
- `litert-lm-native` owns LiteRT-LM bridge artifacts for native-assets and
  Apple SPM-compatible companion packages.
- If native versions changed, prefer the `Sync Native Version & Bindings`
  workflow PR over hand-editing core pins. It also updates Apple SPM companion
  package pins under `packages/` when Apple XCFramework releases changed.

## 2. Version and docs updates

- Update `pubspec.yaml` version.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Companion packages start at `0.0.1` and move independently from the core
  package. Native pin sync records changed companion native pins under
  `Unreleased` but does not bump companion package versions by default.
- In the release-prep PR, bump only companion packages whose native pins or
  publishable package contents changed, move their accumulated `Unreleased`
  notes into the new version section, and keep unchanged companion package
  versions as-is.
- Companion packages publish only after the release-prep PR is merged. The
  release-prep PR merge is the approval boundary; automation pushes the relevant
  package-specific tags, and the publish workflow skips a companion package
  version that already exists on pub.dev.
- Keep current install snippets aligned with root and companion `pubspec.yaml`
  versions. Run `dart run tool/testing/verify_release_docs_versions.dart` before
  opening or merging the release-prep PR.
- Move accumulated `Unreleased` entries into the new version section; remove
  the `Unreleased` heading when it would otherwise be empty. Add it back only
  when the next unreleased change is documented.
- Update `MIGRATION.md` if breaking behavior changed.
- Keep docs pages aligned with new defaults/options.
- Keep local SwiftPM artifact caches out of pub archives. Apple SPM binary
  target pins live in the Flutter runtime companion packages, not in the core
  `llamadart` package.

## 3. Publish flow

A release-prep PR updates versions, changelogs, docs, and pins only; it must not
publish companion packages or the core package before merge. Merging a
release-prep PR is the explicit approval boundary for publishing. After merge,
`release_on_prep_merge.yml` owns companion package tag ordering, the core
`vX.Y.Z` tag, pub.dev publication, docs versioning, and GitHub Release creation.

For automation to run, the merged PR must either carry the `release-prep` label
or use a versioned release-prep branch name such as `release/prep-0.8.12` or
`release/0.8.12-prep`. The automation requires a `RELEASE_AUTOMATION_TOKEN`
repository secret containing a fine-scoped PAT or GitHub App token that can push
tags and trigger tag-based workflows. Do not use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` for
this step because GitHub suppresses most workflow runs caused by that token.

Do not tag the core `vX.Y.Z` release until every companion package version named
in the current install docs is already published on pub.dev. The release
sequence is:

1. Confirm the native GitHub releases referenced by `Package.swift` are live and
   include the pinned XCFramework zip/checksum assets.
2. For each companion package named in current install docs, check whether its
   `pubspec.yaml` version exists on pub.dev:

   ```bash
   package_path=packages/llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter
   package_name="$(awk '/^name:[[:space:]]*/ {print $2; exit}' "$package_path/pubspec.yaml")"
   package_version="$(awk '/^version:[[:space:]]*/ {print $2; exit}' "$package_path/pubspec.yaml")"
   curl -fsSL "https://pub.dev/api/packages/$package_name/versions/$package_version"
   ```

3. If a changed companion version is missing, first merge the release-prep PR.
   The post-merge release workflow then pushes that companion's package-specific
   tag, for example:

   ```bash
   git tag llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter-v0.0.3
   git push origin llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter-v0.0.3
   ```

   The workflow waits for `publish_companion_pubdev.yml` to publish the package
   and re-checks the pub.dev version URL.
4. Tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the core release tag only after the companion packages
   referenced by the release docs are resolvable from pub.dev. Automation pushes
   the core tag after that gate passes.

Current workflows involved:

- `publish_pubdev.yml`: publishes the core package on version tags, creates or
  updates the GitHub Release after pub.dev publishing succeeds, and does not
  publish companion packages.
- `publish_companion_pubdev.yml`: publishes one companion package from a
  package-specific version tag after that package already exists on pub.dev:
  `llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter-v{{version}}` or
  `llamadart_litert_lm_flutter-v{{version}}`. Pub.dev automated publishing
  cannot create a new package, so publish each companion's first version
  manually from a temporary copy, then configure automated publishing on that
  package's pub.dev Admin tab with the matching tag pattern. Use the same
  temp-copy shape as CI before running `flutter pub publish`:

```bash
package_path=packages/llamadart_llama_cpp_flutter
tmp_package="$(mktemp -d)"
rsync -a --delete \
  --exclude='.dart_tool' \
  --exclude='build' \
  --exclude='pubspec.lock' \
  "$package_path/" "$tmp_package/"
(cd "$tmp_package" && flutter pub publish)
```

- `docs_version_cut.yml`: creates versioned docs snapshot on `v*` tags.
- `docs_pages.yml`: deploys docs to GitHub Pages after successful
  `docs_version_cut.yml` runs (and can be manually triggered).
- `release_on_prep_merge.yml`: runs after a release-prep PR is merged into
  `main`, validates the prepared version, publishes any missing companion
  package versions first, pushes the core release tag, waits for pub.dev, and
  confirms the GitHub Release exists.

## 4. Post-release verification

- Verify `release_on_prep_merge.yml`, `publish_pubdev.yml`,
  `publish_companion_pubdev.yml` when relevant, `docs_version_cut.yml`, and
  `docs_pages.yml` all completed successfully.
- Verify pub.dev package page and API docs for the new version.
- Verify the GitHub Release exists and is marked latest.
- Verify docs version selector includes the new release.
- Re-run smoke checks for representative examples.

## 5. If automation is blocked

If `docs_version_cut.yml` cannot push directly to `main` (for example due to
branch protections), run the version cut locally and open a PR:

```bash
cd website
npm ci
npm run docusaurus docs:version 0.6.2
```
