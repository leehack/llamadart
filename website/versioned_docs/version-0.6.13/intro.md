description: Learn what llamadart provides and where to start when building local AI features in Dart and Flutter.
---

`llamadart` is a Dart and Flutter plugin for running `llama.cpp` models with
GGUF files across native and web targets.

## Who this is for

- App developers building local-first AI features in Dart/Flutter.
- Teams that need OpenAI-style HTTP compatibility from local models.
- Maintainers who need predictable native/web runtime integration.

## Core primitives

- `LlamaEngine`: stateless generation API.
- `ChatSession`: stateful chat wrapper over `LlamaEngine`.
- `LlamaBackend`: platform backend abstraction used by the engine.
